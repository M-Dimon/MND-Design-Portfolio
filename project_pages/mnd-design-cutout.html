          <h1>Illustrator Cutout</h1>
          <p>We were given a short introduction on how to use illustrator. In this introduction, we were shown how certain tools in the program works, as well as shown some video tutorials for more in-depth learning. In the lesson we learned, more about how the program is generally used, when it is used, and how it can be used. For example, posters and logos. As the program has different size options, and has a very versatile use, it has a lot of options when it comes to logo and poster design. You can create anything from big posters to tiny stamps, and with the many tools and functions available, creating products becomes fairly easy. </p>
          <br>
          <p>That coupled with the many ready available video tutorials, gives even the less technologically advanced users easy access to intriguing design options. <br>In one of the videos we were introduced to the "paper cutout" effect. Which is a layering principle, that can create depth in photos. </p>
          <br>
          <p>As you can see the photo above, is what i managed to create by following the video tutorial. Personally i found the tutorial very enriching, as it gave me a very hands on learning experience, which I have found to be a more effective way for me, as it helps make information more memorable. </p>
          <p>With the help of these many video tutorials, the usages of the program becomes seemingly endless, as there is lots to learn, and lots you can create.</p>
