                    <li>Have a red thread throughout the website.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Why make this? Purpose?
              <ul>
                <li>Redesign.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make it more stylish, Give it some extra functions, Make it standout/ Memorable. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>Step 2 - Basic design &amp; Features</b></p>
          <p>After shortly brainstorming, I started working with the basics in Adobe XD, creating a simple menu, adding the different buttons for pages. Making each page, and adding the menu to them. Playing around with the colors a bit, before deciding to use a Green with Yellow lettering. </p>
          <p>After the menu was "done", or at least for now, I decided to work on the front page, as it is the landing page of the site. I had briefly before thought of a design I wanted, and tried to no avail to find backgrounds to bring it to life. Only to discover I would have to create it myself, as none of the ones I found fit the measures I needed. I therefore looked for drawings with the components I would need, and got to work in photoshop, where I edited them so they had no background. Once that was done, I imported them into my XD product, and began creating the beautiful bread banner for my Home page. </p>
          <p>After that I inserted the baker's logo and slogan, along with part of the written boxes and the picture from their original frontpage. I also made a information box with the opening info, the different nutritional claims key tags and their Facebook like, which ended up simply being the sentence, as you cannot add links to XD. This box, was also copy pasted onto 3 of the pages, placed in the same location, to create this red thread. </p>
          <p>Once the homepage was done, I moved on to the Intervied, where I added a box to indicate "here is the video", along with the text box found on their own website. After that the page was done. The same was was done on the "Korn, Gær & Kværne"  and the "Om os" I simply added the photos and the text box, made sure they were in the right places, and done. </p>
          <p><b>Step 3 - The "shop"</b></p>
          <p>After the 4 main pages were done came the harder part, making the "Bestil &amp; hent" and the "Kurv/Betal". Both concepts were rather big, with lots of details to be added, like the icons for basket, the add or subtract, spaces for all the bread options, etc.. </p>
          <p>I eventually decided to work smart and created one base consisting of, color boxes and content boxes, in this case picture and text ones. After having made a base design I liked, I simply duplicated until I had the desired amount, and changed pictures as needed. Using the same technique for the - + square and basket icon. </p>
          <p>Once that was done I moved on to the "Kurv/Betal". Here I first made a base of green boxes, which I moved around a few times until I found the layout I liked the most. Then I started adding basic elements like titles for the different boxes, lines to separate different elements, fake purchases to demonstrate the setup and so on.</p>
          <p>Then to be a little extra I added in a "Betaling Metode" along with a "Afhentnings tidspunkt" To showcase how the order and pick-up could be structured, again continuing in the fake purchase, with a fake buyer. All this was then finished with a tiny "Betal" button at the bottom, which i connected to a simple, purchase approved. Which consisted of the basic design (menu) and a simple green box stating the order has been accepted, will be ready for pick-up at xx.xx. </p>
          <p>After that I rechecked the buttons, making sure they would take you to the correct places, double checked I didn't miss anything, as well as edit here and there until it was all to my liking. </p>
