          <h1>Dating App for the Elderly</h1>
          <p>In class we were given a task to make a dating app for either, Kids, Dogs, Young adults or Elderly (70+), I chose to make one for elderly. Which to me meant my focus was to create an app which would allow the elderly to either find a partner or to simply find some company. </p>
          <p><b>Step one - Brainstorm</b> <b>+ First Wireframe</b></p>
          <p>First I brainstormed, target group, design, purpose of app, structure, and over all image for my app design. This made me conclude i would need a simple and clean design and structure, with minimum features, all which had to be either self explanatory or simply leaving no chance to misunderstand. I also decided to make it revolve around love and friendship, as not all elderly are looking for new partners, some simply want company. </p>
          <p>With my brainstorm done I decided to research some color palettes and text fonts, so I could ensure the final design wouldn't be made with a color or text font which was hard to see for the elderly. </p>
          <p>I found 2 pages with information for this.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.sunriseseniorliving.com/blog/may-2015/what-colors-should-you-use-for-aging-eyes.aspx">https://www.sunriseseniorliving.com/blog/may-2015/what-colors-should-you-use-for-aging-eyes.aspx</a></p>
          <p>After this I got to work on the layout, makin a simple wireframe, incorporating the color and text font, to play around with the placement and size of things. I started off with the basic necesseties for an app. Front, Login, Create user, Profile, Home, Chat (active & New), Settings. </p>
          <p>At this point I had already played around with some icons and found some i liked, however, deciding to keep the users (our point of view) plain in some way.  After having the basics, I got some feedback from my group, which gave me some new perspectives and ideas for extra elements. Among them were additional elements for the create a user, which was also added on the profile, example of keyboard, the elements on the home page. </p>
          <!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
          <p><b>Step two - Wireframe 2 Mid-Fi</b></p>
          <p>I first incorporated the extra features, then I went on and added the extra pages, the fillers, which was basic extra pages simply give every added "button" a transfer page. So every chat on the "aktive chat" was given individual pages, which I would I later steps fill with fake people and examples of conversation. The Home people profiles, were given people icons, some basic boxes for descriptions, names and titles, along with view profile pages.</p>
          <p>After that I got some more feedback, from my group as well as from some family and friends, whom I asked to picture it from an elderly's point of view. With this feedback I them moved on to the final Wireframe. </p>
          <p><b>Step three - Wireframe 3 Hi-Fi</b></p>
          <p>In this step I added the fake people, descriptions, chats, help function, extended settings pages, background and logo for the front page and a locked screen. </p>
          <!-- wp:paragraph -->
          <p>After adding the few last touches here and there, I asked for more feedback from friends and family. The majority of which said it was a good design, with high functionality and easy navigation. There was however also some who commented on, color palette, text size and home page design, but those things were minor things, which could easily be implemented at a different time, so I chose to omit them, as they wouldn't have changed the overall layout or design. </p>
