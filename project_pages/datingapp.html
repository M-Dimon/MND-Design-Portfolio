          <h1>Installation Project</h1>
          <p>For our second project, we were tasked with making a new version of the already existing exhibition "DIN Udstilling" from Trapholt. In this show, the visitor gets to experience what it is like to be a museum curator.</p>
          <p>We were introduced to Trapholt and the exhibition; this was done with a presentation done by the museum's curator. After this, we then jumped right into the brainstorming process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Part 1 - Brainstorm</b></p>
          <p>After the presentation, we all brainstormed possible ideas to utilize. During this brainstorm, ideas like AR, VR, shared art, Box of senses, and many others were thought of. However, we knew not all of these ideas would be helpful, and we, therefore, evaluated the different ideas, so we could find out which three we wanted to work with. As a result, we decided to work with the shared art, the AR, and the Box of senses, as they were the ones we found the most interesting and the most reasonable when we considered the client.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As we had now determined what to work with, we decided to brainstorm how to work with them. What to do, how to do it, and what we wanted to achieve with it. This was then written down and divided into different parts, inserted into our scrum board on Trello for an accessible overview of the project. </p>
          <p><b>Part 2 - Making the wireframes &amp; research</b></p>
          <p>After we determined what to make and how we, we moved on to making the actual wireframes, starting with AR, here we split the product into different pages, and each made a basic layout, which we afterward discussed. After this discussion, we decided to add more elements to the AR wireframe, as the ones already made would not fully showcase what and how it would work. So, while some worked on the AR wireframe, some group members started working on the box of senses. In addition, we all decided to work on different parts of the project to use our specific skill-sets and talents, further increasing the work efficiency. Therefore, some researched, while others continued the wireframes, and some worked on the method list for the report.</p>
          <p>During the research, we found statistics, reports, and articles regarding our products and our client. Here among was the information regarding similar exhibitions and visitor statistics for museums across Denmark and specifical visitors to museums with installations art exhibition. Thus giving us further knowledge of our project and gave more insight into what we should focus on. Which then helped us when we began writing our report.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Part 3 - Starting the Report</b></p>
          <p>As each member worked on a part of the project, some had started with the introduction and method list for the report, two areas that could be written regardless of whether the product had been finished. For example, in the method list, we decided to incorporate every method introduced in the first semester, so we later could simply sort through them later to remove the non-used ones. During this, we also looked into what elements needed to be in the report based on the project assignment description, along with what we as a group wanted to incorporate. This was then written down in our shared writing document, with each element being highlighted as they got completed. </p>
          <p>After we had an idea of what the report had to contain, and what we wanted it to contain, we each chose a section to write and got started. The idea was that we wrote separate areas, and then reviewed them together, this helped us ensure we wouldn't write content for the same parts, minimizing the error margin and maximizing our work efforts. As a result, our workload got lighter, as we worked smart instead of hard. </p>
          <p><b>Part 4 - Mid-way pitch.&nbsp;</b></p>
          <p>After the project had been underway for a while, we, along with our classmates, went to Trapholt, the client for the project, to pitch our three ideas and get some feedback to help us choose which would be our final product. As a result, our group decided to go with the Box of senses, as we, after our pitch, found it to be most promising moving forward. During the trip to Tripholt, we also discussed how to move forward with the Box of senses, as we at the end of the project would be doing a type of project fair, where we had to showcase a "final" functioning product. </p>
          <p>Therefore while discussed the feedback given, we brainstormed ideas for the final product, and checked out the actual exhibit in which our product proposal could be incorporated, to help build the foundation for our presentation for the project fair.  This discussion back and forth, along with the brainstorm, made way for more brilliant ideas, and as a result, several sketches of a possible box of senses were created. They varied in their shape, in the way the senses were incorporated, and in the sense of what could and couldn't be incorporated. Resulting in us choosing to make use of a painting from a current exhibition at Trapholt, with us then brainstorming what the senses should showcase to portray the painting. </p>
          <p><strong>Part 5 - Product, Reports, and Folders</strong></p>
          <p>After the Mid-way pitch visit, which left us with new ideas, we moved onto the last phases of the project, which included writing the remaining report parts, and planning how to set up the finished prototype for the showcase fair. Therefore, to increase our productivity, we again worked on separate parts. This time we all worked on the report, however, on different aspects of it.  Some wrote on the missing parts for the report, while others proofread the already written parts, making comments where they edited. We also had one of the members look at the report's layout and design so that when the content was finished, all we would have to do was input it.</p>
          <p>As the report was near finished, part of the group moved on, making the folder for the showcase fair. Here we decided to use similar styles from our report, so there would be a red thread between the project's different parts. Likewise, the final product would also use these similar style elements, primarily the sense icons created for this project. For the folder, we found that minimal text would be better, as the concept of the sense box is very self-explanatory once in use, and lengthy explanations could bias the possible users' way of interacting with the box. As a result, the folder remained very simple, only containing the necessary information regarding the product, along with catchphrases to get the viewer's attention. </p>
          <p><strong>Part 6- Review &amp; Proofreading</strong></p>
          <p>After the folder, the report content, and the report design was done, we all focused on reviewing and proofreading all the written text, check the placements for different elements, and ensuring we answered all our research questions. However, as we were reviewing and proofreading, we realized that the video presentation, which we had yet to make, had to be linked on the front page of our folder. This was a bit of an issue, as we, at that time, had less than 2 hours until we had to hand in our material. Thus we ended up making a concise and quickly edited video presentation, in which our original lo-fi product became the main star instead of the final build we would have otherwise used.</p>
          <p>However, the result of it all was, despite the setbacks, something we all found acceptable, and thus, 30 minutes before the deadline, we added the last touches to everything and handed it in. </p>
