          <h1>CSS Animation; Splat</h1>
          <p>We were tasked with creating an Animation, where we used a sprite, which we were to develop, and CSS code to get it to "move."</p>
          <p><b>Part 1: Brainstorm</b></p>
          <p>At first, I brainstormed what to do and how to do it, as we had to make an animation that could relate to our brand somehow. This was so we could use it on on presentation portfolio for the exam. During my brainstorm, I decided to keep the animation elements simple while also making it a little fun. Thus I ended up choosing to make a ball with a splatter effect to it.
          The idea was to create a moving ball that accidentally splats and then collects itself after a brief confusion. This would be captured with the help of exclamation and question marks, as the ball itself does not have a face.</p>
          <p><b>Part 2 - The sprite</b></p>
          <p>After the brainstorm was done, I opened Adobe Illustrator, where I proceeded to design the ball and create the basic pages for the sprite. During this time, I, in order to create a coherent story, ended up making 33 sprite drawings or scenes, which, when "played," would make the ball sprite move, jump, splat, and then ultimately collect itself again.
          However, when played, the animation was as smooth as desired.  Ideally, to smooth out the animation, more scenes would be added; however, the artboard in Illustrator can only be so long, and there was no room for more scenes. Thus I instead decided to isolate the scenes regarding the splat and jump, focusing on making an animation with them that would run smoothly. As a result, I ended up with 32 scenes.</p>

          <p><b>Part 3 - The animation</b></p>
          <p>After having the new 32 scenes for my sprite, I got to work in the CSS document, incorporating the different needed parts, to ensure my sprite would be able to move.  I inserted the necessary code into my HTML and CSS and corrected it so width and height would match the desired size for my animation, which is 500px by 500px. I then saved it all and opened it in my browser to see what it would look like when playing. After that, I corrected the time so that it would run smoothly, and then it was done. </p>
