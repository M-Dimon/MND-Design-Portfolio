          <h1>Re-design of a website</h1>
          <p>For the first project, we were tasked with redesigning a website of our choosing, so long as it appeared to need a serious makeover. The website my group found was http://www.dansk-international-noedhjaelp.dk/ (Dansk International Nødhjælp), a website by volunteers to help to provide aide to the eastern European countries.</p>
          <p>Although informative and functioning, the website itself didn't make proper use of design principles and therefore appeared messy at times. As a result, we decided to brainstorm ideas about what to and how to incorporate elements, along with what to keep and with how to keep it.</p>
          <p><b>Part 1 - Brainstorm</b><br>During the brainstorm, we decided to minimize the layout and menu while maintaining the information found on the site. This was to create a user-friendly website, with a high readability count, without removing the necessary pages found on the website. We categorized and grouped them, which resulted in the need for four pages, each with access to relevant subpages, making it easier to navigate the website.</p>
          <p>After we did the menu planning, we looked at the overall layout to determine what to keep, which to alter, and figure out which color palette to use. As a result, we decided to use a simple color palette, using blue, black, white, and grey. This was inspired both by the website itself and the research we did into other international aid organizations. We also decided to redesign the logo and give it a fixed position to help brand the website, give it familiarity with its viewers, and change the overall layout for the pages. Hence, readability and user-friendliness become vital features.</p>
          <p><b>Part 2 - Wireframe</b><br>Following the brainstorm, we sprung right into creating the first version of the wireframe, making each page, and playing around with the placement of different elements. As a result, we ended up with the following layouts;</p>
          <p>We inserted the key elements and boxes for picture placement on the pages along with button placement. We also incorporated the new logo design, menu line, and a custom footer containing contact information, among other things, as seen below.</p>
          <p>After the wireframe was done, we got some feedback and then moved on to implement the necessary pictures, extra buttons, and minor details that would take the design to the next level.</p>
          <p><b>Part 3 - Adding details &amp; finishing the prototype.</b><br>After the wireframe was done, we worked on the different sliders we wanted to incorporate, added a hover effect on buttons and the map found on the landing page.</p>
          <p>After that, we ensured that every button on the page functioned. Every bit of information was incorporated and double-checked. Every needed element was working as it should before we moved on to writing the report content.</p>
          <p>While making the product, we continuously wrote and designed the report, and layout for the report, using the same color palette as our product, ensuring a red tread between product and report.</p>
          <p><b>Part 4 - Layout</b></p>
          <p>First, we planned the overall layout for the report. Here we decided how to set up the different pages, where text boxes should go, what they should look like, etc. We decided to keep the overall layout simple while incorporating various elements and pictures of relevance and specific minor details to add some flair to the report. Making it look like the following;</p>
          <p>As the base for the report was done, we got to making the design of the front page, here we incorporated the necessary key elements, along with a few specific details, which related back to the not only the report but also the product in itself. </p>
          <p>As the layout progressed slowly, we shifted in between writing the content and moving it slowly into the report design to see what would work and what wouldn't. Here we also played around with text and picture placement and color elements to help create focus.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Part 5 - Adding Details</b></p>
          <p>After we did the overall layout and the frontpage, we began adding extra elements, including text boxes and pointer arrows, for added effect when discussing details on pictures in the report, resulting in the following;</p>
          <p>After we did the text boxes and the pointer arrows, we added page numbers. As we did this, we also added the newly written parts of the report to fill out the otherwise empty pre-placed text boxes. Thus the report slowly got closer and closer to being done.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>Part 6 - Finalizing the report</b></p>
          <p>After the group added the details and were happy about the report design, we progressed to fully finishing the report's writing while also working on our product on the side. Thus, as we finished the text boxes, they each got added to the report in their respective places. The pages were then put in proper order, to ensure the reading of content would make sense, pictures of the final web design were taken and text boxes and pointers added, leaving us with the following examples.
          </p>
          <p>After everything was added, and we had deemed it "finished", we went and talked one last time with a teacher, to see if anything should be improved. As a result, we ended up adding smaller details here and there, before deciding to hand it in. </p>
