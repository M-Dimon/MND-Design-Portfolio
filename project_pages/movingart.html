          <h1>Moving art</h1>
          <p>Making the art of our choice move in accordance to a story of our own creation. </p>
          <p>For this project I choose a painting by Vincent van Gogh titled Starry Night from 1889, because not only do I have a big fascination with stars, I also find his way of painting to be very inspiring and intriguing . </p>
          <p>Van Gogh was a Dutch national, known for his Post-impressionist&nbsp;paintings, which later made him a famous and influential figure in the history of western art. His art consisted of bold colors and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork&nbsp;that later on contributed to the foundation of modern art. </p>
          <p>His success, however, was not instant, and he suffered from severe mental illnesses which also landed him in asylum's, such as the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole near the Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Here he lived well, being allowed to paint, read and withdraw to his room as he wished.</p>
          <p>It was in his time at the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, he painted the Starry Night, a painting which was in fact very unlike his usual art style, as it was based on imagination rather than what he could see. </p>
          <p>The painting itself is also often associated with the quote “<i>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</i>” By Joseph taken from Genesis 37:9. A quote that is said to be predicting that his family would one day bow to him as an authority, which in turn is something people can connect to Van Gogh as he himself had family who doubted him.</p>
          <p><b>The Project</b></p>
          <p>At first I brainstormed what to do, what I wanted to achieve and show. Since the painting portrays stars, I wanted to try and make them come more to life, by adding some movement to them in some way.  I also brainstormed  other elements I could add, like music or characters. </p>
          <p>To start with I opened up the photo in Adobe photoshop, where I then got to work isolating and creating layers for every star so that I could use them as individual objects in Animate later on. </p>
          <p>After I got done with all the layers and had gotten them saved, i moved on to the Animation progress. Here I first added the background, which was just the painting itself after having removed the cypress tree. </p>
          <p>This was followed by adding each star in their respected location, after making them all into symbols. </p>
          <p>When they were all placed, I then added motion tweens to each and every one of them, so I could get them to rotate, which would make them imitate the sparkle and shine of real stars. </p>
          <p>Once that was done, I went back to photoshop and made a layer for the cypress tree, which added and motion tweened just like I did with the stars. </p>
          <p>After editing and making sure all the motion tweens worked as they should, I watched the animation a few times. Which resulted in me deciding to add a new element, in the form of a UFO. </p>
          <p>After that, I edited it until I was satisfied and then it was done. </p>
          <p>Video of the animation:</p>
          <p>In my animation I tried to make use of the animation principle, Slow in and Slow out, having the UFO enter and exit in slower motions, than it moves during its rotation around the star. To do this I added a lot of motion in the UFO's tween around the time it begins the rotation, making it move faster around it. </p>
